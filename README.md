This repository contains [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com) that picks photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) collections via [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).

Cloudflare Workers are like serverless cloud functions, but they also can cache stuff in Cloudflare CDN to make things faster. If you are not familiar with Cloudflare Workers, visit [Cloudflare Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/). Or you can just press the button instead:
