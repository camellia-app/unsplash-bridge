# Unsplash Bridge

This repository contains [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com) that picks photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) collections via [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).

Cloudflare Workers are like serverless cloud functions, but they also can cache stuff in Cloudflare CDN to make things faster. If you are not familiar with Cloudflare Workers, visit [Cloudflare Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/). Or you can just press the button instead:

## Motivation

This is a bridge to [Unsplash Image API](https://unsplash.com/developers) which respects [Unsplash API Guidelines](https://help.unsplash.com/en/articles/2511245-unsplash-api-guidelines).

Current implementation solves following problems:

- Hides [Unsplash API Access Key](https://unsplash.com/documentation#public-authentication) on server side, so you don't need to pass access key to your client-side application, which is not secure and forbidden by [Unsplash API Guidelines](https://help.unsplash.com/en/articles/2511245-unsplash-api-guidelines).
- Automatically notifies Unsplash about photo downloads, which is also mandatory by Unsplash. It means when a photo is _picked_ or _used_ for something, you should notify Unsplash about this. The worker handles this automatically. See "[Guideline: Triggering a Download](https://help.unsplash.com/en/articles/2511258-guideline-triggering-a-download)" for more details.

It was developed to be used for [Camellia](https://github.com/camellia-app/camellia) needs, so the current subset of features is pretty limited.

## API

The bridge exposes following endpoints:

### GET `/random-collection-entry`

Returns random photo from passed Unsplash collection.

It also notifies Unsplash about downloads. See "[Guideline: Triggering a Download](https://help.unsplash.com/en/articles/2511258-guideline-triggering-a-download)" for more details.

A response is cached on clients for 12 hours with `Cache-Control` header.

It accepts following query-parameters:

- `id` â€” collection ID.

Example:

```http
GET https://your-worker-name.workers.dev/random-collection-entry?id=123
```

Returns following JSON in response:
